This is a project I am creating where when I learn a language I will create a basic example in said language of a program which differentiates an equation and asks the user to
solve it. 

Some things that won't be in these examples:
	- Object Orientation unless neccessary 
	- Complex data types (Vectors and the like)
	- Lambda
	- Structures and Unions

This is really for people who have spent a weekend learning a language and want some code that they can understand reasonably well to read. It isn't by any means perfect but
should demonstrate some important concepts.
